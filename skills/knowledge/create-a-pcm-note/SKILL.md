description: Creates a new note in the PCM vault only by walking the MOC hierarchy with Python choosers, inheriting LCC classification from the deepest selected MOC, and linking the note back into that MOC.

# Create a PCM Note

> Walks through up to three levels of MOC choosers to place a note precisely in the hierarchy, then creates the note in the **PCM vault only** (`~/PCM/`) with inherited LCC classification and links it back into the selected MOC.

## Scope

This skill writes the note to **PCM only** (`~/PCM/`). It does **not** touch the KnowledgeVault (PKM). Its sibling `create-a-pkm-note` is the PKM-only counterpart — a note lives in exactly one vault. MOCs may exist in both vaults (they are categories); notes must not.

## How This Skill Chains

Three Python choosers run sequentially and conditionally — first-level always, second-level only if children exist, third-level only if children of the second-level exist. Each chooser runs inline as a Bash step; Claude captures its output, presents the list, waits for the human to pick a number, then continues. The entire flow happens in one Claude session. The note inherits its LCC classification from the **deepest MOC selected**.

## Prerequisites

- `~/PCM/moc/` must contain at least one first-level MOC
- `~/PCM/notes/` must exist
- `~/PCM/templates/note-template.md` must exist
- Python 3 available (`python3`)

## Parameters

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `DEEPEST_MOC` | The most specific MOC selected through the chooser chain | _(resolved by choosers)_ |
| `NOTE_TITLE` | The full human-readable title of the note | _(asked after MOC selection)_ |
| `FILENAME_SLUG` | Kebab-case note subject for the filename | _(derived from title)_ |

## Background

### Note Filename Convention

Note filenames are prefixed with a lowercased LCC code (dots removed) followed by a kebab-case title:

```
<lcc-prefix>-<kebab-title>.md
```

Examples:
- Classification `SB` + title "40V HP Brushless Bike Handle Brush Cutter" → `sb-40v-hp-brushless-bike-handle-brush-cutter.md`
- Classification `QA76` + title "Linux systemd Timers" → `qa76-linux-systemd-timers.md`
- Classification `T58.5` + title "Cloud Hosting Overview" → `t585-cloud-hosting-overview.md`

To derive the prefix: lowercase the LCC code and remove all dots. Examples: `SB` → `sb`, `QA76` → `qa76`, `QA76.75` → `qa7675`, `T58.5` → `t585`.

### Vault Paths (PCM only)

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Notes | `~/PCM/notes/` |
| MOC files | `~/PCM/moc/` |
| Note template | `~/PCM/templates/note-template.md` |
| LCC outlines | `~/PCM/lcc/` (a symlink to `~/KnowledgeVault/PKM/lcc/`) |

`~/PCM/lcc/` is a symlink to the canonical `~/KnowledgeVault/PKM/lcc/`, so classification lookups work from the PCM path directly.

### MOC Level Detection

- **First-level MOC**: `primary_moc:` field is blank or absent
- **Second-level MOC**: `primary_moc:` is set; its value matches a first-level MOC slug or title
- **Third-level MOC**: `primary_moc:` is set; its value matches a second-level MOC slug or title

## Instructions

1. **Run the first-level MOC chooser** — Run immediately, before asking the human anything:

   ```python
   import os, re

   moc_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/PCM/moc")
   results = []

   for fname in sorted(os.listdir(moc_dir)):
       if not fname.endswith(".md"):
           continue
       path = os.path.join(moc_dir, fname)
       with open(path) as f:
           content = f.read()
       if not content.startswith("---"):
           continue
       end = content.find("---", 3)
       if end == -1:
           continue
       fm = content[3:end]
       primary = re.search(r'^primary_moc:[ \t]*(\S.*)?$', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       if primary and primary.group(1) and primary.group(1).strip():
           continue  # has a parent — skip
       title_m = re.search(r'^title:\s*"?([^"\n]+)"?', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       title = title_m.group(1).strip() if title_m else fname[:-3]
       cls_m = re.search(r'^classification:[ \t]*(\S.*)?$', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       cls = cls_m.group(1).strip() if cls_m and cls_m.group(1) else ""
       lbl_m = re.search(r'^classification_label:[ \t]*"?([^"\n]+)"?', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       lbl = lbl_m.group(1).strip() if lbl_m and lbl_m.group(1) else ""
       results.append((fname[:-3], title, cls, lbl))

   for i, (slug, title, cls, lbl) in enumerate(results, 1):
       print(f"{i}. {title}  [{cls} — {lbl}]  ({slug})")
   ```

   Present the numbered list and ask: "Which first-level MOC does this note belong under? Enter the number." Wait for their answer. Record: `l1_slug`, `l1_title`, `l1_cls`, `l1_lbl`.

   Set `deepest_slug = l1_slug`, `deepest_title = l1_title`, `deepest_cls = l1_cls`, `deepest_lbl = l1_lbl`.

2. **Check for second-level MOCs** — Run this script substituting the selected first-level slug and title:

   ```python
   import os, re

   moc_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/PCM/moc")
   parent_slug = "<l1_slug>"    # substitute
   parent_title = "<l1_title>"  # substitute
   results = []

   for fname in sorted(os.listdir(moc_dir)):
       if not fname.endswith(".md"):
           continue
       path = os.path.join(moc_dir, fname)
       with open(path) as f:
           content = f.read()
       if not content.startswith("---"):
           continue
       end = content.find("---", 3)
       if end == -1:
           continue
       fm = content[3:end]
       primary = re.search(r'^primary_moc:[ \t]*(\S.*)?$', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       if not primary or not primary.group(1) or not primary.group(1).strip():
           continue
       parent_val = primary.group(1).strip().strip('"').strip("'")
       if parent_val.lower() not in (parent_slug.lower(), parent_title.lower()):
           continue
       title_m = re.search(r'^title:\s*"?([^"\n]+)"?', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       title = title_m.group(1).strip() if title_m else fname[:-3]
       cls_m = re.search(r'^classification:[ \t]*(\S.*)?$', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       cls = cls_m.group(1).strip() if cls_m and cls_m.group(1) else ""
       lbl_m = re.search(r'^classification_label:[ \t]*"?([^"\n]+)"?', fm, re.MULTILINE)
       lbl = lbl_m.group(1).strip() if lbl_m and lbl_m.group(1) else ""
       results.append((fname[:-3], title, cls, lbl))

   if not results:
       print("NONE")
   else:
       for i, (slug, title, cls, lbl) in enumerate(results, 1):
           print(f"{i}. {title}  [{cls} — {lbl}]  ({slug})")
   ```

   - If output is `NONE`: no second-level MOCs exist under this parent. Skip to Step 5 (note title).
   - If a list is printed: present it and ask: "Select a second-level MOC, or press Enter to use **[l1_title]** as the target MOC." If the human selects one, record: `l2_slug`, `l2_title`, `l2_cls`, `l2_lbl` and update `deepest_*` to these values. If they press Enter / skip, keep the first-level values as deepest.

3. **Check for third-level MOCs** (only if a second-level MOC was selected) — Run the same script as Step 2, substituting the selected **second-level** slug and title for `parent_slug` / `parent_title`.

   - If output is `NONE`: no third-level MOCs exist. Keep `deepest_*` at the second-level values. Skip to Step 5.
   - If a list is printed: present it and ask: "Select a third-level MOC, or press Enter to use **[l2_title]** as the target MOC." If the human selects one, record: `l3_slug`, `l3_title`, `l3_cls`, `l3_lbl` and update `deepest_*` to these values.

4. **Confirm the target MOC** — Tell the human: "The note will be linked to: **[deepest_title]** (classification: `deepest_cls` — deepest_lbl)." Proceed.

5. **Ask for the note title** — Ask: "What is the title of this note?" Wait for their answer. Challenge any spelling/grammar problems and propose a corrected version before proceeding.

6. **Ask for a one-line summary** (optional) — Ask: "Brief one-line summary for the note's Summary section? (Press Enter to leave blank.)" Wait for their answer.

7. **Ask about body content** — Ask: "Do you have content to add to this note now, or will you edit it later?" If they provide content, record it as `body_content` to write into the `## Details` section. If they say later / press Enter, leave `## Details` blank.

8. **Derive the filename** — Compute:
   - `lcc_prefix`: lowercase `deepest_cls`, remove all dots. Examples: `SB` → `sb`, `QA76.75` → `qa7675`, `T58.5` → `t585`
   - `title_slug`: lowercase the note title, replace spaces and special characters with hyphens, collapse multiple hyphens.
   - `filename`: `<lcc_prefix>-<title_slug>.md`

9. **Get today's date** — Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` for the `created`/`updated` fields.

10. **Create the PCM note** — Write `~/PCM/notes/<filename>`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "<Note Title>"
    aliases: []
    type: note
    classification: <deepest_cls>
    classification_label: "<deepest_lbl>"
    classification_source: lcc
    primary_moc: <deepest_slug>
    related_mocs:
      - "<deepest_title>"
    tags: []
    created: YYYY-MM-DD
    updated: YYYY-MM-DD
    ---

    # <Note Title>

    ## Summary

    <one-line summary if provided, otherwise leave blank>

    ## Details

    <body_content if provided, otherwise leave blank>

    ## Related

    - [[<deepest_slug>|<deepest_title>]]
    ```

11. **Update the target MOC in PCM** — Open `~/PCM/moc/<deepest_slug>.md`:
    - Find the `## Notes` section. If it contains only `- [[]]`, replace that placeholder line with the new link. Otherwise append the link as a new list item.
    - Link format: `- [[<lcc_prefix>-<title_slug>|<Note Title>]]`
    - Update the `updated:` frontmatter field to today's date.

12. **Commit and push in PCM** — Stage the new note and updated MOC, then commit and push:

    ```bash
    git -C ~/PCM add notes/<filename> moc/<deepest_slug>.md
    git -C ~/PCM commit -m "note: add <lcc_prefix>-<title_slug>"
    git -C ~/PCM push
    ```

    Report the commit hash after pushing.

13. **Report completion** — Summarize:
    - Note file created: full path
    - Target MOC updated: full path, with the exact line added
    - Classification applied: `deepest_cls` — `deepest_lbl`
    - Commit pushed: hash

## Success Criteria

- `~/PCM/notes/<filename>` exists with `primary_moc` set to `deepest_slug` and `classification` filled
- The note was **not** written to the KnowledgeVault (PKM)
- Target MOC in PCM contains `[[<lcc_prefix>-<title_slug>|<Note Title>]]` in its `## Notes` section
- Filename follows `<lcc_prefix>-<title_slug>.md` convention (lowercase, no dots in prefix, hyphens throughout)
- `home.md` was not modified
- PCM commit pushed

## Notes

- The human may stop at any chooser level — if they skip the second-level or third-level chooser (by pressing Enter), the note targets the deepest MOC they did select
- `~/PCM/lcc/` is a symlink to `~/KnowledgeVault/PKM/lcc/`; use it for any classification lookups
- `created` and `updated` use plain `YYYY-MM-DD` format (not the `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` Obsidian template syntax — that is resolved by Obsidian's template engine, not here)
- Leave `## Details` and `tags: []` blank for the human to fill in after creation
- For saving a web article into PCM (with image archival), prefer the ingest pipeline `~/PCM/scripts/ingest-html-page.sh <url>` over this manual skill
- Related skills: `create-a-pkm-note` (the PKM-only counterpart), `first-moc-level`, `second-moc-level`, `third-moc-level` (create MOC structure before adding notes)
